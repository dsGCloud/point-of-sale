# Point of Sale (PoS)

**Mike's Project** This fork is meant to fetch a banner value as part of the ConfigMap in order to change the front-end of the application.

The variable is first referenced in service-configs.yaml in the common service folder. And then used in MainPage.vue as VUE_APP_ENV_BANNER

The following steps are to build the app and set YAMLs in an installation already done.

**Point of Sale** is a sample application that simulates a retail store kiosk
used to submit and track orders and payments.

This application is used by Google to demonstrate use cases where
[Anthos](https://cloud.google.com/anthos) clusters are installed and run outside
of Google Cloud Platform _(i.e. on premise bare metal infrastructure)_. The
application is representative of **edge deployments** like that of retail
store-front devices.

This repository also hosts a collection of samples and walkthroughs that enables
learning and experimenting with [Anthos](https://cloud.google.com/anthos) for
edge use cases. All of the samples and walkthroughs are built around the
**Point of Sale** application.

> ðŸ‘“ **Note:** Anthos clusters means Kubernetes clusters that are managed by Anthos.

### Edge computing

Edge computing is a distributed computing paradigm that brings computation and
data storage closer to the location where the action is, to improve response
times and save bandwidth. Multiple industries _(e.g. Retail, Telecommunication,
Manufacturing and Energy)_ are facing a growing demand to provide localized,
consistent, low latency services that expose compute services. Workloads range
from order management, ML for images/traffic analysis/safety, device management
like refrigeration, fryers, etc. [Anthos clusters on Bare Metal](https://cloud.google.com/anthos/clusters/docs/bare-metal) and [Anthos cluster on VMware](https://cloud.google.com/anthos/clusters/docs/on-prem)
are unique solutions for deploying and managing workloads on clusters
distributed across customer data centers and device fleets.
